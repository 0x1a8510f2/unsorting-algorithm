# Unsorting Algorithm

Everyone always talks about this sorting algorithm or that sorting algorightm, but nobody ever mentions an unsorting algorithm. How can sorting algorithms be given all the credit and attention while the unsung heroes that are unsorting algorithms remain unknown to the masses. After all, what use would sorting algorithms be if the data wasn't unsorted in the first place?

This disrespect is therefore unacceptable and must not continue. I, through this very repo, have taken it upon myself to solve this problem once and for all. Feast your eyes upon the fruits of my labour and spread the word, so that unsorting algorithms may finally get the respect they deserve.
